## Explanation

Mirko sets a height parameter H (in metres), and the machine raises a giant sawblade to that height and cuts off all tree parts higher than H (of course, trees not higher than H meters remain intact). Mirko then takes the parts that were cut off.Mirko is ecologically minded, so he doesn't want to cut off more wood than necessary. That's why he wants to set his sawblade as high as possible. Help Mirko find the maximum integer height of the sawblade that still allows him to cut off at least M metres of wood.

Sample Input:
```
4 7
20 15 10 17
```
Sample Output:
```
15
```

### Binary Search
Binary Search Algorithm is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N * log(max(arr)))$

**Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```python
import sys # import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline # definition input
n,m = map(int,input().split()) # input
arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

# Binary Search
left, right, can = 0, max(arr),[]
while left <= right:
    mid = (left+right)//2;cnt=0
    for i in arr:
        if i > mid:cnt += i-mid
    if cnt == m:can.append(mid);break
    elif cnt < m:right = mid-1
    else:can.append(mid);left = mid+1
print(max(can)) # print
```
